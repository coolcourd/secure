    <h1>Passwords</h1>
    <p>If you use the same password for everything <b>STOP!</b></p>

    <p>If someone gets ahold of your password for one site they will have access to everything.</p>
    <p>There are lots of ways to make a secure password.</p>
    <p>One trick is to think of a song, poem, or phrase you know and use it to generate a password that makes sense to you, but no one else.</p>
    <h2>example:</h2>
    <p>"I am a child of God, and He has sent me here." Becomes i@@c0G&Hh$mh</p>
    <p>We took the first letter of every word, used the @ symbol instead of the letter a, & instead of the "and", $ instead of "s", and of course, a capital "G" and "H" for the "G" in "God" and "H" in "He".</p>
    <p>Your email password should be the most secure password you have. If someone has your bank password they have access to all of your money, and that's bad. But if they have your email password, they can reset your bank password, and Facebook and everything else. They can also now use your email account to try and attack the people in your address book.</p>

    <p>Here is a fun site to practice making secure passwords. <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/" target="_blank">howsecureismypassword.net</a></p>
    <p>Saving your password in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox can be a bad idea too. These passwords can be revealed  in plain text by an attacker with access to your computer or account.</p>
