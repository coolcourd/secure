    <h1>Tools & Tips</h1>
    <p>Look for the secure padlock in the URL bar of your browser. This helps make sure that only the website you are visiting can read the information you are sending. (Hopefully they wont share.)</p>

    <h2>Ad Blockers</h2>
    <p>You can install an ad blocker for your browser to protect you from ads and third-party information tracking.</p>
    <h2>Brave</h2>
    <img src="/assets/brave.PNG" alt="Brave browser">
    <p>A great privacy-centered Chrome-like browser is <a href="https://brave.com/download/" target="_blank"> Brave</a>. Brave will block ads and trackers by default while upgrading insecure requests when possible and saving your passwords only locally. If you like Google Chrome, you will hardly notice the switch.</p>
    <h2>Duck Duck Go</h2>

    <p>Google is really good at everything they do, but they aren't afraid to collect tons of data about you. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">Duck Duck go</a> is a high quality, privacy respecting search engine that will give you honest, unbiased search results.</p>
    <p>You should be aware of your safe search settings in any search engine. I recommend using "strict" unless you have good reason not to.</p>
    <h2>Private (incognito) browser windows</h2>
    <img src="/assets/private-window.jpg" alt="private window">
    <p>Private windows are a neat way to may sure that nothing gets saved in your browser while browsing. Most browsers have an option of starting a new private window. If you are using a public computer to log in to your email account you wouldn't want your password to save, or your account to stay logged in when you close the window. If you ever need an extra secure browsing session, you should use a private (incognito) window.</p>
