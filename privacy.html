    <h2>You are being tracked</h2>
    <p>It is practically unavoidable. Information about you is on the internet.</p>
    <p>Facebook makes <a href="https://theconversation.com/shadow-profiles-facebook-knows-about-you-even-if-youre-not-on-facebook-94804">shadow profiles</a> of people that have never signed up for accounts</p>
    <p>You can find pictures, relatives, email addresses, and even home addresses of almost ANYONE by searching <a href="https://www.peoplefinders.com/name"> their name</a> online.</p>
    <p>The more you make public on ANY SITE, the more anyone can find out about you.</p>
    <p>Google, Apple, and Facebook track you much more than you probably realize.</p>
