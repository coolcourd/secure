  <h2>Phishing</h2>
  <h3>Explanation of Attack</h3>
  <p>
    Phishing is probably the most common type of attack. You can spot phishing in several ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Phishing is performed through messages to the to the victim.
      </li>
      <li>
        Phishing will typically have URLs in the message which recdirect the victim to malicious websites in which may execute code either stealing information, or even sending the victim to a website that imitates the legitimate website in which the subject of the message was about. URLs also may be displayed legitimatily to the victim, but when hovered over will actually redirect the victim elsewhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Phishing messages aimed at gathering a user’s information typically seem very urgent. This is an attempt to trick the victim into disclosing sensitive data (usernames, passwords, etc.) in order to fix something that seems like it could get worse without the victim's interaction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Phishing email messages typically have a deceptive subject line to get the victim to beilieve the email has come from a trusted source (or is legitimate). Attackers use a forged sender’s address or the spoofed (faked) identity of the business or person. They usually copy contents such as texts, logos, images and styles used on the legitimate website to make it look genuine.
