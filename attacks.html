  <h2>Phishing</h2>

  <h3>Explanation of Attack</h3>
  <p>
    Phishing is probably the most common type of attack. You can spot phishing in several ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Phishing emails will typically have URLs in the message which send the victim to malicious websites that steal information. URLs also may be displayed legitimately to the victim, but when hovered over will actually redirect the victim elsewhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Phishing messages aimed at gathering a userâ€™s information typically seem very urgent. This is an attempt to trick the victim into disclosing sensitive data (usernames, passwords, etc.) to fix something that seems like it could get worse without the victim's interaction.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Imagine logging in to a site that looks exactly like the site you think you are logging in to... but it's not. Here is a safe, fun, mock google site lazily made by me, Courd. <a href="https://g--o--o--g--l--e.com" target="_blank"> Go to Google </a>Always look at the URLs.</p>
  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <h2>Baiting</h2>
  <img src="/assets/quid.PNG" alt="quid pro quo">
  <p>In general, this means that an internet service may ask you for something in return for another thing. Be cautious of what you give for what you get. You should also be cautious of who you are giving to.</p>
  <h2>Pretexting</h2>
  <p>Imagine that your friend's email or social networking account gets hacked and the hacker starts sending you stuff.</p>
  <p>Look for signs that it may not be your friend.</p>
  <p>Is this an old friend you haven't talked to in a while that is randomly sending you files to look at? Are they talking to you the same way they usually do? Does the message seem abnormally urgent or threatening?</p>
  <h2>Trojans</h2>
  <img src="/assets/trojan.jpg" alt="trojan horse">
  <p>Trojans are a type of malware that is hidden in what you actually wanted.</p>
  <p>for example: imagine that you want to download something simple and safe like Minecraft. you go to your favorite search engine and type "Download Minecraft" You click on the first link and hit download. Pretty soon, you have installed Minecraft and are enjoying the game, but since you weren't careful to check what site you downloaded from, the sketchy site also installed a keylogger sending every key and password you type off to their servers to do with as they please.</p>
  <h2>Catfish</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.mtv.com/shows/catfish-the-tv-show/episode-guide" target="_blank">Catfish</a> are online predators who disguise themselves as someone or something attractive to you. Catfish often try to meet you in person and can be extremely dangerous. Be very cautious when talking to anyone online that you do not know. Check to see if you have mutual friends and ask your friends about them. Avoid building any sort of relationship with anyone online if you cannot validate their identity.</p>
