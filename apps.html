    <p>The apps you use can put you at risk even when installing from the App Store or Google Play.</p>
    <p>Apps have been known to check your location frequently and use it to tailor ads to you.</p>
    <img src="/assets/access-contacts.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Some apps may request access to your contacts or media to sell your contact info or private photos.</p>
    <p>They can give you scary looking push notifications to trick you into giving them more information or money.</p>
    <p>Lots of apps will give you settings to control how private they keep your information.</p>
    <p>You can also control what permissions you give to an application from your phone's settings. Your flashlight app probably doesn't need access to your contacts and media. Your address book app probably does. Do you get the picture?</p>
    <p>Tik Tok is known to read your clipboard (copy/paste) at a frequent interval and other sleazy practices. I recommend avoiding Tik Tok altogether.</p>
    <p>If you are ever presented with anything not virtuous, most social apps let you indicate that you are not interested in the post. Fill your mind and your news feeds with things that are virtuous, lovely, of good report and praiseworthy.</p>
